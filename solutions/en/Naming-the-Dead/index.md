Digital technologies provide new ways to access and interact with data about civil and international conflict that is more comprehensive and immediate. Using said data so that it is both more digestible and interactive can encourage us to reflect in ways that otherwise wouldn’t be possible. 

The Bureau of Investigative Journalism launched a project, [Naming the Dead](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/namingthedead/the-dead/?lang=en), which published biographical and circumstantial information of all victims in the US drone strikes in Pakistan since 2004. This campaign humanizes otherwise faceless victims,that are not just alleged terrorists, but innocent men, women, and children.
